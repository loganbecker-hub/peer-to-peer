[+] Run multi.o and connect to the network using Putty / Hyperterminal. 
[+] Alternatively, refer to my "p2p" Repo to connect using "./p2.o". Check the IP_ADDRESS and PORT as well in the code.
[+] The "p2.c" file does not have "receiving" capabilities yet, but it can easily be added.

For this repo
-------------
Step 1: Set the "IP_ADDRESS", "PORT", and "MAX_CONNECTIONS".  
Step 2: Type: make all.  
Step 3: Type: make run.  
Step 4: Use Putty or Hyperterminal to test connections to the network OR skip this step and goto "P2P repo" below for the alternate method.  
Step 5: When you are done testing it-> Type: make clean.  

For the P2P repo
